There are several steps to the design of a good project, knowing what is required depending on the given circumstances allows for a 
superior product.

The first thing to do is to know what you want to achieve with your programs, having a goal from the offset will dictate the direction 
of all proceeding choices. 

You then need to decide how how you want to implement these goals with some broad choices. What's the programming language? Where should
usersbe able to see your content? Will other coders be looking at your work? Which users should have access to your content? How many 
levels of abstraction will there be? What is the security like? Will your code operate differently when used in different enviornments?
These sorts of questions should be asked and addressed earlier in the process.
